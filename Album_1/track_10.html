            Please do understand that the information provided in this page is not at all a professional analysis. 
            I am only writing this as a hobby and love for a niche genre of music that is rejected by the masses due to its political connotation. 
            Every opinion and review are purely of my own humble points of view and knowledge. Thank you for reading my thoughts on this piece of music.

        <h3>Background:</h3>
            <p>
                “We Are Masters of the Farm (우리는 농장의 주인)” is a Korean song that was composed in 1969 by the Merited Artist Kim Jong-Suk, and the lyrics were written by Ri Sang-Chol.[1] 
                The song was performed in the 90s by the renowned Pochonbo Electronic Ensemble (보천보전자악단 (PEE)). 
                The PEE rendition is an arranged version by the People's Artist Kim Sung-Hae and performed by male instrumentalists and Merited Actress Kim Kwang-Suk and Ri Pun-Hui as vocals.[2] 
                The song is only found in the PEE CD <i>Album 1</i> track № 10. An instrumental rendition of this song with a different name was performed by another well-known DPRK music group Wangjaesan Light Music Band (욍재산경음악단), titled “Farm Girls (농장 처녀)”.[3] 
                Apart from the renditions by the two major bands of the DPRK, there exists a karaoke version and a fast-paced rendition of “We Are Masters of the Farm” that is played around the five minute mark of the movie <i>Urban Girl Comes to Get Married (1994)</i>.[4] 
                Information about this song is very scarce and hard to come by due to the nature of the country of origin.

        <h3>About this Song:</h3>
        <p>
            “We Are Masters of the Farm” encourages the listeners, especially the young people of Korea, to dedicate their youth to their hometown and achieve full harvests every year. 
            It is meant to inspire and motivate people to mobilise and work on farms. It has an uplifting, moderate-paced, and emotional melody with harmonious vocals by male and female singers that are meant to evoke a strong sense of pride within the audience. 
            “We Are Masters of the Farm” can sometimes be heard in the background of KCTV news reports of farmlands and farmers of the DPRK.
        </p>

        <h3>Structure:</h3>
        <p>
            The song is 4 minutes and 35 seconds long; beginning with a prelude of 1 minute and 43 seconds. 
            The prelude quickly builds up a strong and energetic melody. It introduces the leitmotif that becomes apparent throughout the song. 
            Like most PEE songs, the instrumental is performed by using synths. 
            A commonality within DPRK songs is that they are often performed by a group of singers to further cement the idea of the power of working as a collective.
        </p>

        <p>
            The first verse is performed by the female singers Merited Actress Kim Kwang-Suk and Ri Pun-Hui. 
            This verse encourages the youth to contribute to achieving a great year of harvest, and asserts that it is worth the effort to work on the farms back in their hometown. 
            It is a call to action and an attempt to rally the able-bodied to help fulfill the quotas.
        </p>

        <p>
            The second verse is performed by a male chorus, with female singers providing support vocals. 
            This verse declares that the people are the legitimate owners of the farms. A common theme in communist arts that proclaims the people to own the means of production instead of the bourgeoisie. 
            The song continues its optimistic message and beckons the people to dedicate all their physical and mental strength towards a brighter future for their hometowns. 
            Eventually both male and female vocals combine, symbolising harmony and the importance of teamwork.
        </p>

        <p>
            The song enters interlude, slowly building up to the final message that repeats the same propaganda to solidify the idea in the listeners' mind.
        </p>

        <p>
            The third verse is a chorus of both male and female vocals. It is mostly a refrain of the first verse, with only the final part emphasising on the need for a bonanza year. 
            The song ends with a powerful chorus with the final message calling the people to fulfill their duties.
        </p>

        <h3>Opinion:</h3>

        <p>
            “We Are Masters of the Farm” is my most favourite song ever. Its lyrics are very motivational and it has the most soulful chorus I have ever heard. 
            The song has a very unique melody and instrumentals that are a very particular style of PEE. Only a few other DPRK songs have come close to matching this masterpiece's energy. 
            This song, per its title, claims that the people are the true owners of their farms. It is without a doubt a communist propaganda meant to encourage the people to invoke the idea of collectivisation and the celebration of the overthrowing of the landlord class.
